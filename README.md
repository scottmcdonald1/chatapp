## Live Demo

## User Stories

The initial concept for the app came from a coding challenge via the [devjam](https://devjam.vercel.app/project/Chat-App-9) group.

### Dev Jam User Stories

User Stories

 1. ✅ User is prompted to enter a username when he visits the chat app. The username will be stored in the application
 2. ✅ User can see an input field where he can type a new message
 3. ✅ By pressing the enter key or by clicking on the send button the text will be displayed in the chat box alongside his username (e.g. John Doe: Hello World!)

Bonus features (optional)

 1. The messages will be visible to all the Users that are in the chat app (using WebSockets)
 2. When a new User joins the chat, a message is displayed to all the existing Users
 Messages are saved in a database
 3. User can send images, videos and links which will be displayed properly
 4. User can select and send an emoji
 5. Users can chat in private
 6. Users can join channels on specific topics

 ## Tech Stack

 I am using these challenges to learn/get more familiar with React and this project was built with Next.js

 ### What I've learned

 1. more practice with hooks, which are still pretty foreign to me though this helped, specifically useState.
 2. Router and useRouter, which I used to pass in the username via a path variable -- this was the biggest and most rewarding hurdle I overcame.

 ### What's next

 I would say the next big thing to tackle, related to this project, would be websockets as I have very little experience with them if any at all.
